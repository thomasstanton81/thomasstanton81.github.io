            <p> Starfish or known as Sea Star's are part of the phylum echinoderm family and are closely related to sea urchins like sea cucumbers. The name sea Star was created due to the fact that these stars are not fish. Sea Stars are the most common animal found in the ocean and eat almost anything that comes across them on the sea floor. Sea stars have bumps on themselves which help them bring water into their body's so that they can move with the aid of tube feet on the bottom of the sea star's. As most people know, sea stars are able to regenerate arms, this is due to the fact that sea stars are able to amputate their own limbs as a mean for self defense. It helps because if a predator has a limb of a sea star, the star can amputate it's own leg so that it can get away and survive. Although the sea star has one less limb it starts the regrowth process which can take up to a year to complete.
